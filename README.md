> **Note:**\
> If Windows credentials are not added correctly during switching, the OpsHub Server service will not be started.\
> To avoid such an occurrence, the user will have to manually set the service log-on credentials for OpsHub Server Service in case wrong Windows credentials are added at the time of switching.

## Follow the below mentioned steps to set the credentials in the OpsHub Server Services:

1. Open the services application and search for `OpsHub Server Service`.
2. Right-click on the service, select **Properties** and go to the **Log On** Tab.
3. Enter Windows credentials in **This account**.

> **If the user is registered with a domain**, the username format will be `username@domain` or `domain\username`.\
> **Otherwise**, the username format will be `.\username`.
